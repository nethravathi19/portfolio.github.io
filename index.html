    <h3><span>Title: </span>AVOID FOOD WASTAGE</h3>
    <h3><span>Description: </span>This project is used to manage wastage foods in a useful way. Every day the
people are wasting lots of foods. So we have to reduce that food wastage problem through online. If
anyone has wastage foods they are entering their food quantity details and their address in that
application and then the admin maintain the details of food donator.
  The donator can create the account and whenever they are having wastage food they can login
and give request to the admin. And the admin also maintain the buyer (orphanage, poor people,)
details too. After the admin view the donator request and give the alert message like time to come
and collect the food.
And the admin collect foods from donator through their nearby agent then provide to nearest

message to that donator. 
 This project is food redistribution is an enormously successful social innovation that tackles food
waste and food poverty. The user’s details are maintained confidential because it maintains a
separate account for each user.</h3>

    <h3><span>Title: </span>TECHNICAL PAPER ON ROBOTICS</h3>
    <h3><span>Description: </span>Robotics is an  interdisciplinary  branch of  engineering  and  science  that includes  mechanical
engineering ,electronic engineering ,information engineering ,computer science , and others. Robotics
deals with the design, construction, operation, and use of  robots , as well as  computer systems  for their
control,  sensory feedback , and  information processing .
These technologies are used to develop machines that can substitute for humans and replicate human
actions. Robots can be used in many situations and for lots of purposes, but today many are used in
dangerous environments (including  bomb detection  and  deactivation ), manufacturing processes, or
where humans cannot survive (e.g. in space, under water, in high heat, and clean up and containment of
hazardous materials and radiation). Robots can take on any form but some are made to resemble
humans in appearance.</h3>
